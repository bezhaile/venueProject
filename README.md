<strong> Venue Project</strong>

The system is presented to user via a web app that can accessed on mobile
devices as well as computers. This helps the system be accessible to the majority of
the users in Addis Ababa with access to smart phones and personal computers. The
system provides several categories and options regarding price, capacity and other
venue needs. Through this system, we aim to facilitate an efficient and time saving
venue inquiry for the population of Addis Ababa
